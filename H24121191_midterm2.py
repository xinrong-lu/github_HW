    # 1. Create a 2D list of zeros representing the maze map with dimensions N rows by M columns.
    # 2. Start at the top-left cell of the maze map and add it to the path list.
    # 3. While not at the bottom-right cell of the maze map:
    #     a. If at the bottom row of the maze map, move right.
    #     b. If at the rightmost column of the maze map, move down.
